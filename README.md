Project 02 - Data Wrangling
Data wrangling is nothing but cleaning the raw data into neat and clean data by applying different methods .
for data wrangling we used two important liberaries here,
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
   First of all we uploaded csv file which is dataset1 in our jupitor notebook and then applied different methods on them
   here,we firstly check the information about the dataset1 so it gives the information like how many rows and columns are present in dataset .
   then we check the datatypes of dataset columns and rows ,so that we also found out which are unique values present over there.
   after thatwe check the null values, how many null values are resent by isnull() method.
   then we checked the duplicate values if any present, by duplicated() method.
   then we uploded the daataset2 in jupiter notebook by read.csv method
   and we merge dataset1 and dataset2 by using outer joint
   after merging this dataset we perform different methods on this merged datasets named as data.
   after checking null values,datatypes,unique values, duplicate values on data then we check the outliers in the dataset.
   we checked outliers in dataset and the use bargraph to represent that outliers.
   then on this merged data we check the skewness of the data by skew() method.
   then we upload the dataset3 by read.csv method
   then by using concatinate method we concat that merged data with dataset3.
   then again we clean up the data like finding unique,treating missing values, dulicates, datatypes, unique value treatment an dall
   after that we checked the skewness of this concat2 .
   and then also we treated the outliers.
        In this way we did our second project which is Data Wrangling.
